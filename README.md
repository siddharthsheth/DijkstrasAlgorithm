# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Problem Description

Task. Given an directed graph with positive edge weights and with n vertices and m edges as well as two vertices u and v, compute the weight of a shortest path between u and v (that is, the minimum total weight of a path from u to v).

Input Format. A graph is given in the standard format. The next line contains two vertices u and v.

Constraints. 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, u != v, 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, edge weights are non-negative integers not
exceeding 10^3.

Output Format. Output the minimum weight of a path from u to v, or −1 if there is no path.
